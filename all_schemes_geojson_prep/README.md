This takes a version of the all_schemes_data.geojson file which contains a list of scheme objects that contain information about schemes which have already bid for ATF funding.
It converts these objects into objects that can contain either a BrowseScheme or a PipelineScheme object allowing multi-scheme geojson files to be used more generally across the app, and particularly in scheme Sketcher.
